# Power The Cadets

Drupal module to provide custom handling of YEA's Power The Cadets calendar and contribution page.

## Notes to the developer or site administrator:

* No configuration is needed, but hardcoded CiviCRM Entity IDs are referenced in 
  constants POWERTHECADETS_CONTRIBUTION_* at the top of powerthecadets.module.
* This module assumes a particular configuration for the 'tour_calendar' view, and 
  for the "Power the Cadets" contribution page (id = POWERTHECADETS_CONTRIBUTION_PAGE_ID)
